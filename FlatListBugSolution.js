The solution involves implementing the `keyExtractor` prop correctly within the FlatList component.  This ensures React Native can efficiently identify and update individual list items.  The `FlatListBugSolution.js` file demonstrates this, using a unique identifier from each item as the key. This improves the performance of the FlatList component, especially when working with a large dataset.
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
/>
```
Ensure each item in the data array has a unique `id` property, or use another unique identifier that is part of each item's structure.
