In React Native, when using FlatList with a large dataset, you might encounter performance issues if you don't optimize the rendering process.  A common mistake is failing to use the `keyExtractor` prop correctly, leading to inefficient updates and re-renders.  If the `keyExtractor` is missing or improperly implemented, React Native might struggle to identify which items have changed, resulting in unnecessary re-renders of the entire list or even crashes.
